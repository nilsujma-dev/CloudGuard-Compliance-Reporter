## CloudGuard Compliance Assessment and Reporting Tool for Multi-Cloud Environments

This GitHub repository features a Python script designed to interact with the Check Point CloudGuard API for multi-cloud compliance assessment and reporting. The script facilitates fetching, filtering, and documenting compliance assessments from CloudGuard for specified entities in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

### Script Functionality
1. **CLI Arguments Handling**: The script accepts command-line arguments for authentication, cloud platform selection, account name, and entity names.
2. **Dynamic Cloud Account and Platform Handling**: Based on the provided platform and account name, the script fetches the relevant cloud account ID and organizational unit path.
3. **Compliance Assessment Fetching**:
   - Constructs payloads for CloudGuard API requests.
   - Retrieves the last compliance assessment results for the specified entities in the chosen cloud account.
4. **Data Filtering and Processing**:
   - Filters and organizes the fetched data based on the specified entity names.
   - Handles cases where entity names are not found in the compliance results.
5. **Excel Report Generation**:
   - Converts the processed data into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Exports the DataFrame to an Excel file, creating a comprehensive compliance report.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Cloud Compatibility**: Supports compliance assessments across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes.
- **Entity-Based Filtering**: Allows for targeted compliance assessments of specific entities within the cloud environment.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Streamlines the process of generating detailed compliance reports in Excel format.
